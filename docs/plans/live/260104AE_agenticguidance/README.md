# Plan: 260104AE_agenticguidance

## Context
- **Plan ID**: 260104AE_agenticguidance
- **Worktree**: `/home/code/AgenticEngineering-agenticguidance`
- **Branch**: `agenticguidance`
- **Objective**: Refactor orchestration to be generic, split planning entrypoints (build/teach), and transition to MMD-driven dynamic workflows.

## Session History

|---------|------|---------|
| 1 | 2026-01-04 | Initial worktree setup |
| 2 | 2026-01-06 | Entrypoint refactor, CLI capability mapping |
| 3 | 2026-01-06 | Agent self-review (19 agents), Friction Remediation (7 tasks) |
| 4 | 2026-01-06 | Ralph loop (8 iterations), created teach plan, 180+ friction points |
| 5 | 2026-01-08 | Example alignment (7 phases completed) |
| 6 | 2026-01-09 | Plan structure standardization, 6 audits, 6 review plans |
| 7 | 2026-01-09 | Plan cleanup: consolidated remediation plans, archived superseded |
| 8 | 2026-01-09 | Ralph loop: DECISION-001 + DECISION-002 + teach Phases 1-5 (20 tasks) |

## Active Decisions

### DECISION-001: Legacy Agents (planner-phases, planner-teach)
**Status**: COMPLETED (Session 8)

**Decision**: Keep existing AgenticGuidance structure, mark legacy agents as deprecated.

**Completed**:
- [x] Functionality absorbed: planner-phases → orchestration-planning Phase Determination; planner-teach → planner-guidance
- [x] No dangling references in active code
- [x] Created `DEPRECATED.md` for planner-phases
- [x] Created `DEPRECATED.md` for planner-teach
- Plan: `completed/plan_live_cleanup_deprecation.yml`

### DECISION-002: Test Agents Migration
**Status**: COMPLETED (Session 8)

**Decision**: Migrate test-user-simulator, test-service, test-builder to AgenticGuidance.

**Completed**:
- [x] All 3 agents migrated to modules/AgenticGuidance/agents/test/
- [x] Each agent has manifest.yml (version 2.0), process.yml (PATH RESOLUTION SEMANTICS), inputs.yml (layer references)
- [x] planner-test manifest updated with MIGRATED status
- [x] test category manifest updated with migrated agents
- Plan: `completed/plan_live_build_migration.yml`

## Phase Status

| Phase 0: Friction Remediation | COMPLETED | 7/7 tasks |
| Phase 0.5: Friction Remediation Phase 2 | PENDING | 11 tasks (4 CRITICAL, 7 HIGH) |
| Phase 1: CLI Offloading | Pending | 4 tasks |
| Phase 2: Entrypoint & Schema | Pending | 2 tasks |
| Phase 3: MMD Implementation | Pending | 3 tasks |
| Phase 4: Asset & Example Alignment | COMPLETED | 7 phases |
| Phase 5: Agent Self-Review Testing | COMPLETED | 19 agents tested x2 |
| Phase 6: CLI Fitness Testing | COMPLETED | CLI verified |
| Phase 7: Plan Cleanup | COMPLETED | Session 7 |

## Next Session Priorities

### Priority 1: Teach Plan Phase 6 (LOW PRIORITY - DEFERRABLE)
```bash
# Plan: live/plan_live_teach_consolidated.yml
# Status: Phases 1-5 COMPLETE (20 tasks)
# Remaining: Phase 6 - Loop context and invocation awareness (5 tasks, LOW priority)
# Note: These are improvements, not blocking issues
```

### Priority 2: Deploy Worktree Remediation
```bash
# Plan: live/plan_guidance_deploy_worktree_remediation.yml
# Task: Fix deploy-worktree guidance based on audit findings
```

### Priority 3: Reviewer Context Optimization
```bash
# Plan: live/plan_guidance_reviewer_context.yml
# Task: Reduce planner-reviewer context by 50-60%
```
